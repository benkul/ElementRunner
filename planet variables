planet variables
x location -changes as player variable time changes need function to determine current location
y location
x orbit out  - rotational constants - could be globally defined or planet specific. 
y orbit down - rotational constants

commodities sold on planet = list with name, quantity, current price
-function to change commodity price based on quantity on hand

fucntion to determine planet location 
	while time greater than 360 remove 360 store as local time
- 	location x + x orbit out (cos(time* pi/180))
	location y + y orbit up (cos(time* pi/180))
